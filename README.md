### Groups
1. Supervised learning 
- predictive model
- uses other variables to predict target variable
- training data includes target values
- 2 categories: regression or classification

  a. Regression
  - numeric continuous outcome
  
  b. Classification
  - categorical outcome - binary/ multinomial
  - predict probability of class

2. Unsupervised learning - descriptive model
- aims to spot clusters in data
  
  a. Clustering
  - divide into homogenous groups
  
  b. Dimension reduction
  - reduces number of variables
